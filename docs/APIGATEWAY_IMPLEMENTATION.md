# API Gateway Implementation - Complete ✅

## Summary

The API Gateway has been successfully implemented using **YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy)**, Microsoft's high-performance reverse proxy solution. The gateway serves as the single entry point for all microservices in the booking system.

## Implementation Details

### Technologies Used

- **YARP (v2.3.0)**: Modern reverse proxy for .NET
- **Serilog**: Structured logging
- **ASP.NET Core Health Checks**: Service monitoring
- **Docker**: Containerization

### Features Implemented

1. **Request Routing**
   - `/api/users/*` → UserService
   - `/api/bookings/*` → BookingService
   - `/api/payments/*` → PaymentService

2. **Middleware**
   - Request/Response logging with unique request IDs
   - Global exception handling
   - CORS support

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Gateway health endpoint: `/health`
   - Active health checks for all downstream services (10-second intervals)
   - Automatic failover when services are unavailable

4. **Logging**
   - Console output (structured JSON)
   - Seq integration for centralized logging
   - Request timing and status code tracking

### Project Structure

```

├── ApiGateway.csproj              # Project dependencies
├── appsettings.json               # Production configuration
├── appsettings.Development.json   # Development configuration

└── Middleware/

    └── GlobalExceptionHandlerMiddleware.cs
```

### Configuration

**Production (Docker)**:
```json
{
  "ReverseProxy": {
    "Clusters": {
      "users-cluster": {
        "Destinations": {
          "destination1": {
            "Address": "http://userservice"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Development (Local)**:
- Uses same configuration for consistency
- Service names resolve via Docker network

## Testing Results

### Gateway Info Endpoint
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/
Response: 200 OK
```

### Health Check
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/health
Response: 200 OK (Healthy)
```

### User Registration via Gateway
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/users/register
Response: 200 OK
Success: User registered through API Gateway
```

### User Login via Gateway
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/users/login
Response: 200 OK
Success: JWT token returned
```

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Access the gateway
http://localhost:5000
```

### Service Ports

- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:5000
- **UserService**: http://localhost:5001 (direct) or via gateway
- **BookingService**: http://localhost:5002 (direct) or via gateway
- **PaymentService**: http://localhost:5003 (direct) or via gateway
- **Seq Logs**: http://localhost:5341

## Key Benefits

1. **Single Entry Point**: Clients only need to know one URL
2. **Service Abstraction**: Internal services can change without affecting clients
3. **Load Balancing**: Ready for multiple service instances
4. **Health Monitoring**: Automatic service health tracking
5. **Request Tracing**: Every request gets a unique ID for debugging
6. **Centralized Logging**: All gateway logs in Seq
7. **Performance**: YARP provides high-throughput, low-latency proxying

## Monitoring

### Real-time Logs

View logs in Seq: http://localhost:5341

Filter by:
- Service: `Service = "ApiGateway"`
- Request ID: `X-Request-Id = "<guid>"`
- Status codes, paths, methods, etc.

### Health Checks

YARP performs automatic health checks:
- Interval: Every 10 seconds
- Timeout: 5 seconds
- Policy: ConsecutiveFailures

View health status:
```bash
docker logs apigateway | grep "Probing destination"
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] JWT Authentication middleware (validate tokens at gateway)
- [ ] Rate limiting (per client/IP)
- [ ] Request/Response transformation
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] API versioning support
- [ ] Response caching
- [ ] WebSocket support
- [ ] Aggregated Swagger documentation

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/ApiGateway/README.md`

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check gateway is running
curl http://localhost:5000/

# Check health
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","email":"test@example.com","password":"Pass@123","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User"}'

# Test user login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"Pass@123"}'
```

## Conclusion

The API Gateway is fully implemented, tested, and operational. It successfully routes requests to all microservices, provides health monitoring, implements comprehensive logging, and is ready for production use. The gateway follows best practices for microservices architecture and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
